# Power System Design: Integration of a 600 MW Wind Farm

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the design of a power system for integrating a 600 MW wind farm into the western service territory of Island Electric Company (IEC). The primary goal was to develop a cost-effective transmission system that ensures reliability, minimizes system losses, and maintains stability under varying generation conditions.

### Key Objectives
- **System Integration:** Incorporate a new wind farm into the existing grid using efficient transmission lines and ensure stability with the decommissioning of the Pheasant substation.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize the selection of transmission lines to balance infrastructure costs and operational efficiency.
- **Loss Minimization:** Reduce system losses while maintaining operational reliability, particularly during times of variable wind generation.
  
### Design Process
1. **Initial System Analysis:**
   - Contingency analysis of the existing system revealed overload issues at specific substations, prompting the need for reconfiguration and optimization.
  
2. **Transmission Line Optimization:**
   - A detailed analysis of different transmission line types and their capacities at 161 kV and 345 kV was conducted. Based on performance and cost, the 161 kV lines were chosen for most of the network, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and losses.
  
3. **Cost and Sensitivity Analysis:**
   - The cost breakdown of the transmission lines and system losses over a 5-year period was analyzed, highlighting areas where cost savings could be achieved without compromising system reliability.
  
4. **Final Design Recommendation:**
   - The recommended system connects the NewWind substation to four nearby substations using 161 kV lines. This design ensures the grid can handle 0 MW, 240 MW (40% capacity factor), and 600 MW scenarios while maintaining low losses and controlling costs.

### Project Highlights
- **System Resilience:** The design accommodates fluctuations in wind generation while maintaining system reliability during peak load conditions.
- **Cost Breakdown:** The final design results in a total estimated cost of â‚¬169,037,000, with over half the costs attributed to system losses. Alternative designs were considered to reduce costs, including omitting certain transmission lines, but these led to higher system loads and less flexibility.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Tested various scenarios, including 240 MW (40% capacity factor) and 600 MW full load conditions, to ensure robustness of the proposed design.

### Conclusion
The project successfully presents a cost-effective and efficient solution to integrate renewable energy into the IEC grid. The design ensures minimal losses, handles extreme load scenarios, and adheres to the project's cost constraints.
